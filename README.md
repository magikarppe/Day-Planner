# Day Planner
A planner to schedule your workday to-dos!

## How it Works
✓ The application displays timeblocks for standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.).

✓ Each timeblock contains an input field and save button.

✓ Clicking a time block's save button saves the input text to local storage, allowing the text to persist when the application is refreshed.

✓ The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.

✓ Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in a past, present, or future hour.
